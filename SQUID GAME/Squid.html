 <p
 style="font-size:30px"> All of the players (except for Il-nam, who is actually rich and just participating to have fun) are there because they're so deep in poverty that being out in the real world is a Fate Worse than Death. They also each have a trauma-riddled backstory relating to their debt and destitution. It's clear that some of them form familial attachments to each other. Sang-woo sees Gi-hun as a brother, Ali calls Sang-woo "hyung" ("older brother"), and Gi-hun reminds Il-nam of his son. But given that this is a game where they literally have to either murder each other or get executed until only one player is left, none of these family-like relationships end well.
