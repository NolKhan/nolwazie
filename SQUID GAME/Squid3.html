    <td style="font-size:22px">Played by: Lee Byung Hun, Tom Choi (English dub), Carlo Vázquez (Latin American Spanish dub).The black-masked overseer of the games. His real name is Hwang In-ho, and he's Jun-ho's long lost older brother and the winner of the 2015 contest.Wears a long black coat with a hood as part of his ensemble.He shoots one of his underlings for allowing his mask to be removed.Dresses in all black with an ominous mask that conceals his entire face? Check. Speaks in a deep, menacing voice that's electronically modulated? Check. Serves as The Dragon to an elderly Big Bad. Check. Is secretly related to one of the most heroic members of the cast? Double check. Given he is the one commanding the pink guards on-screen, he is presented as the main antagonist of the series... up until it's revealed in episode 9 that he's only The Dragon to the real Big Bad and creator of the games, Player 001 (Oh Il-nam).In the final episode, he threatens Gi-hun to "just board the plane" when the former calls them via the same card they give towards unknowing players. Gi-hun isn't fazed by this and actually leaves the plane boarding station.Hypocrite,claims to highly value the fairness of the games towards the players, executing anyone who ruins that fairness by giving players an unfair advantage. But when the VIPs see that one of the last players is a glass maker who can tell which glass plate is safe to jump on and are complaining that it ruins the excitement, the Front Man doesn’t object to dimming the lights of the room to make the game harder for the players and more exciting for the VIPs.The Front Man finds himself haunted by the memory of his younger brother Jun-ho’s final moments after being killed by him.</td>
    <td style="font-size:22px">The masked guards who enforce the rules of the games. They are classified, in ascending order of rank and mask type, as workers (circles), soldiers (triangles) and supervisors (squares).Their black masks with shape symbols on them are a fairly simple, but nonetheless intimidating design that helps signify from the get-go that they mean danger for the players.They conceal their faces behind black masks and carry out the orders of the Front Man without question.Despite being in the same boat and basically wearing the same outfits, the guards are divided into three classes according to their shape.Workers (identified by their circle mask) carry out menial and odd jobs and are the lowest in the pecking order. Their main tasks are to collect and prepare players for the games and dispose of the eliminated ones to incinerate.Soldiers (identified by their triangle mask) are armed with rifles around the clock and permitted to execute players on the spot should they failed one of the games and get eliminated. They can boss around Workers but look up to Supervisors as their superiors.Supervisors (identified by their square mask) ensure the workers and soldiers follow the rules and overlook the games firsthand as the spokesperson. There's only a handful of these guards who take no orders from anyone but The Front Man.Just in case you needed any extra proof that these guys are bad to the bone, one of the guards involved in the organ-stealing racket confesses that he and his fellow guards enjoyed raping a female player who they thought was dead.Eliminated contestants are eliminated, period. It doesn't matter if some of them are still alive. The guards will put the failed contestants into coffins before cremating them in furnaces anyway. No exceptions.When player No. 119 gets a gun on one of them and makes him take off his mask, he is shocked to see how expressionless the guard is.When Gi-hun loudly demands that the guards take action after Deok-su beats Player 271 to death for breaking his bottle of water, the guards just stand there as stoic as ever.In Episode 8, we see this again when Gi-hun asks the guards to provide medical assistance for Sae-byeok, who is slowly bleeding to death, only for them to return with a coffin.The hot pink hazmat suits which they all wear don't make them any less intimidating when they heartlessly gunned down eliminated players and dispose them into coffins, alive or not, for incineration. Also, the coffins they used are wrapped with a pink ribbon as some sick joke.</td>
    <td style="font-size:22px">A collection of wealthy English-speaking men mostly from Western countries who enjoy betting on the games.The VIPs wear golden mask with various animals within it, Il-nam himself wears an owl mask.VIP No. 4, the man with the tiger mask. He hits on the waiter and threatens to kill him if he doesn't have sex with him but is not aware that the waiter is actually a cop in disguise.During his last moments, Oh Il-nam reveals that both the ultra poor & rich have something in common, which is the lack of joy in their lives. Which encourages him and the other VIPs to create the games with Il-nam deciding to be a player before his time runs out.They act like entitled teenagers, one of them tells the other to shut up about Shakespearean literature, the Tiger-mask VIP thinks he can force a waiter to perform fellatio on him with death threats and the other VIPs cheer him on to have his way with the waiter.One of the VIPs is quite proficient with literature as he quotes William Congreve's "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" after Mi-nyeo drags Deok-su down with her during the glass bridge game.</td>
    <td style="font-size:22px">A recruiter for the games.When the people he plays against don't pay him up after the first game they lose, he offers to slap them in exchange for the money they couldn't pay him. He ends up delivering a lot of these to the players, who continue to play against him in order to win.He approaches potential players with a suitcase with at least a few million won in cash, offering to pay them all of the money in the briefcase if they play a game with him.hen he ends up losing all of his cash in the briefcase that amounts to millions of won, his only reaction is to smile and happily clap for the players when they win. Subverted, because it's likely his tactic to keep them interested in playing and lure them to the Squid Games.It's easy to forget given his brief appearance in the series, but the Salesman seems to be a very skilled ddakji player and manages to flip the paper in a single attempt when it's his turn to play.he never forces them to pay up with money and lets them win and keep it because his true intention is to round up unsuspecting victims for the Squid Game.His name remains a mystery, as he doesn't even give his name to potential players when he introduces himself, leading to him to just being referred to as the "Salesman". Although given the situation of the other workers in the Squid Games, he likely was told to never reveal his name and only focus on recruiting players.A creepy, smiling salesman he may be, but even he shows he can be scared. Such as when he approaches Gi-hun about the games. He instantly drops his smile and puts his hands up when he thinks Gi-hun is pointing a gun at him.When he approaches potential players, he let's them know after they win his game the amount of debt they still owe to others and every other little detail about their lives that lead them to rock bottom. He then adds they have a chance to pay it all off if they join the Squid Games.</td>
